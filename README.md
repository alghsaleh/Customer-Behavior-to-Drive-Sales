# Customer Behavior to Drive Sales

## Overview
This notebook is to be submitted for "Project 4: Write A Data Science Blog Post" as part of [Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree). In this project, I am tasked with choosing a dataset, identifying three questions, and analyzing the data to find answers to these questions while following [CRISP-DM Process](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS3RA7_15.0.0/com.ibm.spss.crispdm.help/crisp_overview.htm). I am then tasked with writing a blog post in which I communicate findings to non-technical audience.
